# GameOfLife

## Description
It a construction of an automata which takes the idea of survival from [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and combines with the implementation of survival insticts.  

## Functionalities
It is just a cellular automata visualization with random movement.

## Difficulties during development
+ Developed in Highschool with out any CS knowledge so I din't know what I was doing.

## What I learned
+ That CS is fun and hard, but that's what makes it fun.

## Improvements and further work
+ There are endless possibilities but I would like to finish the book that it was based on which is the book [The Natrue of Code](https://natureofcode.com) by Daniel Shiffman.

- [] Implement a cellular automata with genetic algorithm, may be in 3D? 

## Comments

+ None.
